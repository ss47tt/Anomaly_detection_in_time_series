# Anomaly_detection_in_time_series

How to do anomaly detection in time series data?

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption

2. I used the energy consumption by COMED CSV file for this project which can be found in the dataset. The aim is to use anomaly detection methods to find outlier data points in time series.

3. There are three types of anomaly detection methods used in this project, these are, Z score, interquartile range, and median absolute deviation.

4. The time-based features used are hourly, daily, monthly, lag one hour, lag one day, and lag one week.

5. Rolling windows are used to smoothen the data.
